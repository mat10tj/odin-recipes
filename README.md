For this project you have to create a main recipe page and link it to
different recipe pages. 

The task for the recipe pages was to find a 
recipe online and create your own page using the
info you found. 

First you label the top of your recipe page with an h1 tag 
of your recipe name then place an image of it you find online. 
Next give a short description of the food under the image and below
that you make a heading for ingredients then make an unordered list 
of the ingredients needed. After that make a steps heading then
put an ordered list on how to make the food.

I learned quite a lot from this like how my documents should be
structured with all the images and separate pages in their own folders.
After completing the first recipe page i had to make another so i
put another on the main page but they were next to eachother and i
didn't like that so i figured i'd use a br tag to separate them.
I also just straight copied the text for the other two recipe pages
i found online cuz i was too lazy type all that out, Problem was 
i had to make tags and wrap em around the text i just pasted. The other problem was when i would start the opening tag the closing tag autocompleted then i would have to delete that closing tag scroll all
the way to the end of the line then put the closing tag which was 
a pain. So i did some googling and found out the emmet abbreviation 
stuff, With ctrl + shift + p i could select emmet abbreviation and type
my tag and it would wrap it around the whole line of text!

As i got to working on the recipe pages i used the live server plugin 
to auto refresh my pages when i saved but on accident i opened the
wrong page with it and not my home page so i had no way of getting
to my home page so i had the idea of adding a home page return 
button then copy/pasted it to my other page and bam now i can
get to all of them no matter which page i start live server on.

Honestly I'm pretty proud of this i know it's not pretty but i
like that it works and that i actually made something on my own.
Also some of the images were gigantic and i wasn't gonna make
a stylesheet becuase it wasn't taught yet so i got to thinking and used the width attribute to limit their size.

One more thing they way ../ was used to access the images when i
used the src attribute helped me with navigating the command line 
because i struggled moving the downloaded images out of my 
downloads folder then to my repos folder.
